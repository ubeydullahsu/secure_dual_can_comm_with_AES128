## Project Overview

This project implements an innovative cybersecurity solution for **legacy automotive CAN systems** (CAN 2.0B) that overcomes the critical 8-byte frame limitation to provide ISO/SAE 21434 compliant security. By utilizing dual CAN interfaces on the STM32F4VE microcontroller, I tried to achieve secure transmission of 16-byte AES-128 encrypted sensor data packets without requiring CAN FD hardware.

**Key Features**:

- AES-128 encryption of sensor data
- Hardware-accelerated cryptography
- 10ms frame reassembly timeout
- Automatic error recovery
- Complete ISO/SAE 21434 documentation

## Hardware Limitations and Innovative Solution

### The Challenge: CAN 2.0B Constraints

| Limitation | Impact | Our Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **8-byte frame size** | Insufficient for encrypted data | Split data across two CAN buses |
| **1 Mbps bandwidth** | Limited throughput | Parallel transmission via dual CAN ports |
| **No built-in security** | Vulnerable to attacks | AES-128 + CRC-32 verification |
| **Single bus architecture** | Single point of failure | Redundant dual-bus design |

### Dual-CAN Security Protocol

    Transmitter->>CAN1: Frame 1 (Encrypted Part 1)
    Transmitter->>CAN2: Frame 2 (Encrypted Part 2)
    CAN1->>Receiver: Part 1 (ID: 0x111)
    CAN2->>Receiver: Part 2 (ID: 0x112)
    Receiver->>Receiver: Reassemble within 10ms
    Receiver->>Receiver: AES-128 Decryption
    Receiver->>Receiver: Verify CRC-32 & Timestamp
    alt Validation Successful
        Receiver->>ECU: Process Secure Data
    else Validation Failed
        Receiver->>Logger: Security Alert
    end

```

**Innovative Aspects**:

1. **Hardware Resource Optimization**: Leverages existing dual CAN peripherals on cost-effective microcontrollers
2. **Time-Synchronized Reception**: 10ms window ensures data integrity without external synchronization
3. **Fault-Tolerant Design**: Continues operation with single CAN bus failure
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing CAN 2.0B vehicle networks
